      About Me
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-10">
      I’m a full-stack software developer with a strong focus on building
      data-driven web applications and scalable systems. I enjoy working across
      the stack — from backend data modeling and APIs to frontend architecture
      and performance-focused UI.
    </p>

    <!-- What I Do -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
        What I Do
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Most of my work centers around designing and building applications that
        help users make better decisions using real-world data. I’ve worked on
        projects involving analytics platforms, dashboards, internal tools, and
        full-stack consumer applications.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">
        I’m particularly interested in clean architecture, performance, and
        choosing the right tools for the problem — whether that’s React and
        Next.js, Astro and Svelte, or backend systems built with Node, PHP, or
        Python.

        How I Think About Software
      </h2>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          I prioritize clarity and maintainability over clever abstractions.
        </li>
        <li>
          I design systems to scale incrementally rather than over-engineering
          upfront.
        </li>
        <li>
          I value performance and user experience, especially in data-heavy
          applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          I enjoy learning new frameworks and understanding why they exist —
          not just how to use them.

        What I’m Looking For

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        I’m interested in roles where I can contribute to meaningful products,
        work with thoughtful engineers, and continue growing as a full-stack
        developer. I enjoy environments that value collaboration, ownership,
        and well-reasoned technical decisions.
